Hariyo Bazar is a multivendor e-commerce platform, where people can buy or sell second hand items and even donate unused items. According to the statistical data of 2017, waste is accountable for 3% of total greenhouse gas emissions. (eurostat, 2020)This online marketplace is for people who want to sell or donate their unused products and for people who are looking for 2nd hand things at a cheap price. So, instead of throwing away unused stuff, some people might be interested in buying such items at lower price and this way reusing stuff will result in a decrease of emission. 
This system also uses a recommendation engine to suggest products to the user. It uses content based recommendations which is a part of natural language processing. For content based recommendation, TF-IDF and cosine similarity is used. The title of the product is used as a keyword and those keywords are processed in TF-IDF vectorizer and cosine similarity is calculated. To determine the similarity of two vectors, cosine similarity is used as it computes the cosine of the angle amongst two vectors. The cosine similarity is calculated by using the formula. 
𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦(𝐴, 𝐵) = 𝐴 ⋅ 𝐵 ‖𝐴‖ ⋅ ‖𝐵‖ 
Where, A and B are two vectors and ‖𝐴‖ and ‖𝐵‖ are magnitude of A and B. The values vary from -1 to 1, with -1 being the most dissimilar and 1 being the most close.
